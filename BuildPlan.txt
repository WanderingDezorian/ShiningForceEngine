Pre-release v3:
* Incorporate entry into simple "battle"- for now, use a simple map, win by walking over the single "enemy"
* Add NPCs to maps. NPCs should move, but do not need animations yet. Demonstrate fixed position, path following, and brownian motion profiles. NPCs should block player motion, and should not be able to walk on blocked squares.
* Add conversations with NPCs. Demonstrate yes/no questions, storyline flags, and portraits. Portraits do not need animation yet.
* Add sound effect support
Pre-release v4:
* Focus on battles, with this release demonstrating movement and targeting.
* Incorporate allies and multiple enemies.
* Demonstrate initiative, with players and enemies taking turns as appropriate.
* Demonstrate limited movement range per turn, shining-force style.
* Demonstrate target selection for attacks.
* Demonstrate simple attacks- no animation, instant kill of target.
* Demonstrate simple AI- move straight towards nearest ally, attack if possible.
Later releases:
Exact order of releases will depend on the needs of the story team. These should include graphics improvements (animations, etc), incorporating combat rules, incorporating AI, incorporating any special things the story needs, and incorporating a real start screen and opening scene.
